    <h1>Pricing Policy</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Burrpy, we are committed to providing our customers with high-quality, home-cooked meals at transparent and fair prices. This Pricing Policy outlines how we determine prices for our services, any additional fees, and our policy regarding price changes.</p>

    <h2>Base Pricing</h2>
    <p>Our meal prices are determined based on the cost of preparation charged by our partners. Prices for each meal are listed on our website and mobile app.</p>

    <h2>Delivery Fees</h2>

    <h2>Subscription Plans</h2>
    <p>For regular customers, we offer subscription plans at discounted rates. Subscribers can choose from weekly or monthly plans, with the price depending on the number of meals selected.</p>

    <h2>Discounts and Promotions</h2>
    <p>From time to time, we may offer promotional discounts or special offers. These will be advertised on our website and through our email newsletters.</p>

    <h2>Taxes</h2>
    <p>All prices are inclusive of applicable sales taxes according to local laws.</p>

    <h2>Price Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to adjust our prices at any time. However, we will provide advance notice of any price changes through our website and email notifications.</p>
